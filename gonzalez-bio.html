<title>Jared Gonzalez - Bio</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
My name is Jared Gonzalez and my current major is information and management of technology with a concentration in cybersecurity. I recently chose cybersecurity as my concentration because i am very interested in how everything works in that scene, and hopefully one day I will be able to protect a company.  
 
I am bilingual and have passed IST 256 which helped me sharpen my skills in Python and I am working on learning more coding languages.  
Outside of my school hours, I love to play and watch soccer. Or as they say in Madrid where I just studied abroad a semester or from where I'm from Mexico, they call it futbol or football. I also love traveling and finding new places to eat.

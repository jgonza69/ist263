  <h1>Jared Gonzalez's Biography</h1>

  <h2>Personal Info</h2>

  <p>My name is Jared Gonzalez, and my current major is information and management of technology with a concentration in cybersecurity. I recently chose cybersecurity as my concentration because I am very interested in how everything works in that scene, and hopefully one day I will be able to protect a company.</p>
  
  <p>I am bilingual and have passed IST 256, which helped me sharpen my skills in Python, and I am working on learning more coding languages.</p>

  <p>Outside of my school hours, I love to play and watch soccer. Or as they say in Madrid, where I just studied abroad a semester, or from where I'm from, Mexico, they call it futbol or football. I also love traveling and finding new places to eat.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing soccer</li>
    <li>Listening to music</li>
    <li>Watching sports</li>
  </ul>
